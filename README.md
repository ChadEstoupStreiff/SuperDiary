# Super Diary

**Super Diary** is a powerful, AI-enhanced web application for organizing, searching, and extracting content from your documents.  
Inspired by tools like *Paperless*, it leverages state-of-the-art models to unlock the full potential of your file collection.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Smart Search**: Find files using a powerful search engine that understands context. It searches *within* your documents using the app’s full suite of AI tools.
- 🧠 **AI Extraction**:
  - **LLMs** (llama3) for text understanding, summarization, tagging, and Q&A.
  - **Whisper** for audio transcription.
  - **PaddleOCR** for OCR on images.
  - **BLIP** for image understanding and captioning on images.
- 📂 **Universal File Support**: Text, PDF, images, audio, markdown, and more.
- 🔒 **Local-First**: Your data stays yours. All processing (including AI) is done locally—unless you opt to use ChatGPT or Gemini.
- 💻 **Lightweight & Powerful**: Runs on any machine with at least 8 GB RAM—even without a GPU!

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Back**: Python / FastAPI / SQLAlchemy  
- **Front**: Streamlit  
- **AI**: Llama3, Whisper, PaddleOCR, BLIP  
- **Infra**: Docker for deployment

### TODO / Ideas
Ideas:
- Favorites files ? Will display on top when search
- Pin file to dashboard ?
- Button refractor ?
- A robot that looks for files and update summaries if needed (like if the summary is older that file date, in reupload for exemple)

Bugs:  
None found :)

TODO: 
- Test search on big volume (tokens on summaries may explode search time)

Optimization:
- on search, don't create a new connection for each file
