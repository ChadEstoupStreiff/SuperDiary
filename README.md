### TODO / Ideas
Ideas:
- Favorites files ? Will display on top when search
- Pin file to dashboard ?
- Button refractor ?
- A robot that looks for files and update summaries if needed (like if the summary is older that file date, in reupload for exemple)

Bugs:  
None found :)

TODO: 
- Test search on big volume (tokens on summaries may explode search time)

Optimization:
- on search, don't create a new connection for each file
