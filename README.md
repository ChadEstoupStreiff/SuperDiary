# Super Diary
**Super Diary** is a powerful, AI-enhanced web application for organizing, searching, and extracting content from your documents.
Inspired by tools like *Paperless*, it leverages state-of-the-art models to unlock the full potential of your file collection.

  - **Whisper** for audio transcription.
  - **PaddleOCR** for OCR on images.
  - **BLIP** for image understanding and captioning on images.
- üìÖ **Calendar Integration**: Add events to provide context and link them to your files and projects.

## TODO / Ideas
Ideas:
- Favorites files ? Will display on top when search
- Pin file to dashboard ?
- A robot that looks for files and update summaries if needed (like if the summary is older that file date, in reupload for exemple)
- Github link to add context to chat ?
- Super notes with block ( #%% delimiters )
- audio transcription with online models (mistral or chatgpt ?)
- Page for contacts, add contacts to projects, add tags to contact
- Page de biblio (on int√©gr√© au viewer), contenant certains fichiers et les liens entre eux pour faire une visualisation graph
- Change app name (it's more of a super assistant)
- CLIP search on images ?

Bugs:  
None :)

TODO: 
- Page (for volume on front, back can handles a lot of files)

Optimization:
- on search, don't create a new connection for each file
